  <h2>History</h2>
  
  <p>The origin of chess is a controversial matter. India, Persia, Central Asia and China, all of them, have good reasons to claim to be the cradle of chess. 
 The earliest texts mentioning this game are from the beginning of the 7th century A.D.; three are written in Pahlavi (middle Persian) and one is in Sanskrit, the Harshacharita. 
 In one of their texts, which is a tale, the Persian narrator explained that Chatrang (their word for chess) had been sent to them by an Indian King. 
 This is why several experts believe that Chess had originated in northwest India, by about the early 7th century. 
 Its early form was known as chaturaṅga (Sanskrit: चतुरङ्ग), literally four divisions [of the military] – infantry, cavalry, elephants, and chariotry, represented by the pieces that would evolve into the modern pawn, knight, bishop, and rook, respectively.
 Chaturanga was played on an 8×8 uncheckered board, called ashtāpada. Thence it spread eastward and westward along the Silk Road. The earliest evidence of chess is found in the nearby Sasanian Persia around 600, where the game came to be known by the name chatrang. 
 Chatrang was taken up by the Muslim world after the Islamic conquest of Persia (633–51), where it was then named shatranj, with the pieces largely retaining their Persian names. In Spanish "shatranj" was rendered as ajedrez ("al-shatranj"),
 in Portuguese as xadrez, and in Greek as ζατρίκιον (zatrikion, which comes directly from the Persian chatrang), but in the rest of Europe it was replaced by versions of the Persian shāh ("king"), which was familiar as an exclamation and became the English words "check" and "chess". 
    The word "checkmate" is derived from the Persian shāh māt ("the king is helpless").</p>

  <h2>1200-1700: Origins of the modern game</h2>
  
  <p>The game of chess was then played and known in all European countries. A famous 13th-century manuscript covering chess, backgammon, and dice is known as the Libro de los juegos. 
  The rules were essentially similar to those of the Arabic shatranj. The differences were mostly the use of a checkered board (the Arabs used a plain monochrome board) and the habit of allowing some or all pawns to make an initial double step. 
  In some regions, the Queen (who has replaced the Vizier) and/or the King could also make an initial leap of two squares with some conditions.</p>
  
  <p>Around 1200, the rules of shatranj started to be modified in southern Europe, and later, several major changes made the game essentially as it is known today. 
  These modern rules for the basic moves appeared in intellectual circles of Valencia, Spain around 1475 and then have been quickly adopted in Italy and south of France before diffusing in all Europe.
  Pawns gained the option of advancing two squares on their first move, while bishops and queens acquired their modern abilities. The queen replaced the earlier vizier chess piece towards the end of the 10th century and by the 15th century had become the most powerful piece; consequently, modern chess was referred to as "Queen's Chess" or "Mad Queen Chess".
  Castling, derived from the "kings leap" usually in combination with a pawn or rook move to bring the king to safety, was introduced. These new rules quickly spread throughout western Europe.</p>
  
  <p>Writings about chess theory began to appear in the 15th century. The Repetición de Amores y Arte de Ajedrez (Repetition of Love and the Art of Playing Chess) by Spanish churchman Luis Ramírez de Lucena was published in Salamanca in 1497. 
  Lucena and later masters like Portuguese Pedro Damiano, Italians Giovanni Leonardo Di Bona, Giulio Cesare Polerio and Gioachino Greco, and Spanish bishop Ruy López de Segura developed elements of openings and started to analyze simple endgames.</p>

  <h2>1700-1873: The Romantic Era in chess</h2>
  
  <p>In the 18th century, the center of European chess life moved from the Southern European countries to France. The two most important French masters were François-André Danican Philidor, a musician by profession, who discovered the importance of pawns for chess strategy, and later Louis-Charles Mahé de La Bourdonnais, who won a famous series of matches with the Irish master Alexander McDonnell in 1834.
  Centers of chess activity in this period were coffee houses in major European cities like Café de la Régence in Paris and Simpson's Divan in London.</p>
  
  <p>The rules concerning stalemate were finalized in the early 19th century. Also in the 19th century, the convention that White moves first was established (formerly either White or Black could move first). 
  Finally, the rules around castling were standardized – variations in the castling rules had persisted in Italy until the late 19th century. 
  The resulting standard game is sometimes referred to as Western chess or international chess, particularly in Asia where other games of the chess family such as xiangqi are prevalent.
  Since the 19th century, the only rule changes have been technical in nature, for example establishing the correct procedure for claiming a draw by repetition.</p>
  
  <p>As the 19th century progressed, chess organization developed quickly. Many chess clubs, chess books, and chess journals appeared. There were correspondence matches between cities; for example, the London Chess Club played against the Edinburgh Chess Club in 1824.
  Chess problems became a regular part of 19th-century newspapers; Bernhard Horwitz, Josef Kling, and Samuel Loyd composed some of the most influential problems. In 1843, von der Lasa published his and Bilguer's Handbuch des Schachspiels (Handbook of Chess), the first comprehensive manual of chess theory.</p>
  
  <p>The first modern chess tournament was organized by Howard Staunton, a leading English chess player, and was held in London in 1851.
  It was won by the German Adolf Anderssen, who was hailed as the leading chess master. His brilliant, energetic attacking style was typical for the time. 
  Sparkling games like Anderssen's Immortal Game and Evergreen Game or Morphy's "Opera Game" were regarded as the highest possible summit of the chess art.</p>
  
  <p>Deeper insight into the nature of chess came with the American Paul Morphy, an extraordinary chess prodigy.
  Morphy won against all important competitors (except Staunton, who refused to play), including Anderssen, during his short chess career between 1857 and 1863. 
  Morphy's success stemmed from a combination of brilliant attacks and sound strategy; he intuitively knew how to prepare attacks.</p>
