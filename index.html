  <h1>Chess</h1>
  
  <p>Chess is a recreational and competitive board game played between two players.
 It is sometimes called Western or international chess to distinguish it from related games such as xiangqi. The current form of the game emerged in Southern Europe during the second half of the 15th century after evolving from similar, much older games of Indian and Persian origin.
 Today, chess is one of the world's most popular games, played by millions of people worldwide at home, in clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments.</p>
  
  <h2>Rules</h2>
Chess pieces are divided into white and black sets. While the sets may not be literally white and black (e.g. the light set may be a yellowish or off-white color, the dark set may be red), they are always referred to as "white" and "black".
Each set consists of 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. The pieces are set out as shown in the diagram and photo. The players of the sets are referred to as White and Black, respectively.
The game is played on a square board of eight rows (called ranks, denoted 1 to 8 from bottom to top according to White's perspective) and eight columns (called files, denoted a to h from left to right according to White's perspective). 
The 64 squares alternate in color and are referred to as light and dark squares. The chessboard is placed with a light square at the right-hand corner nearest to each player.
Thus, each queen starts on a square of its own color (the white queen on a light square; the black queen on a dark square).
