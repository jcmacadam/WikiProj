  <h1>Chess</h1>
  
  <p> Chess is a recreational and competitive board game played between two players.
 It is sometimes called Western or international chess to distinguish it from related games such as xiangqi. The current form of the game emerged in Southern Europe during the second half of the 15th century after evolving from similar, much older games of Indian and Persian origin.
 Today, chess is one of the world's most popular games, played by millions of people worldwide at home, in clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments.</p>
  
  <h2>Rules and Setup</h2>
  <p>Chess pieces are divided into white and black sets. While the sets may not be literally white and black (e.g. the light set may be a yellowish or off-white color, the dark set may be red), they are always referred to as "white" and "black".
Each set consists of 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. The pieces are set out as shown in the diagram and photo. The players of the sets are referred to as White and Black, respectively.
The game is played on a square board of eight rows (called ranks, denoted 1 to 8 from bottom to top according to White's perspective) and eight columns (called files, denoted a to h from left to right according to White's perspective). 
The 64 squares alternate in color and are referred to as light and dark squares. The chessboard is placed with a light square at the right-hand corner nearest to each player.
Thus, each queen starts on a square of its own color (the white queen on a light square; the black queen on a dark square).</p>

 <h2>Movement</h2>
 <p style="font-family:times>In competitive games, the colors are allocated by the organizers; in informal games, the colors are usually decided randomly, for example by a coin toss, or by one player concealing a white pawn in one hand and a black pawn in the other, and having the opponent choose. 
White moves first, after which players alternate turns, moving one piece per turn (except for castling, when two pieces are moved).
A piece is moved to either an unoccupied square or one occupied by an opponent's piece, which is captured and removed from play. 
With the sole exception of en passant, all pieces capture by moving to the square that the opponent's piece occupies.
Moving is compulsory; it is illegal to skip a turn, even when having to move is detrimental. A player may not make any move that would put or leave the player's own king in check. 
If the player to move has no legal move, the game is over; the result is either checkmate (a loss for the player with no legal move) if the king is in check, or stalemate (a draw) if the king is not.
Each piece has its own way of moving. In the diagrams, the dots mark the squares to which the piece can move if there are no intervening piece(s) of either color (except the knight, which leaps over any intervening pieces).</p>

  <ul>
  <div class="b"><li>The king moves one square in any direction. The king also has a special move called castling that involves also moving a rook.</li>
  <li>A rook can move any number of squares along a rank or file, but cannot leap over other pieces. Along with the king, a rook is involved during the king's castling move.</li>
  <li>A bishop can move any number of squares diagonally, but cannot leap over other pieces.</li>
  <li>A queen combines the power of a rook and bishop and can move any number of squares along a rank, file, or diagonal, but cannot leap over other pieces.</li>
  <li>A knight moves to any of the closest squares that are not on the same rank, file, or diagonal. 
  (Thus the move forms an "L"-shape: two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically.) 
  The knight is the only piece that can leap over other pieces.</li>
  <li>A pawn can move forward to the unoccupied square immediately in front of it on the same file, or on its first move it can advance two squares along the same file,
  provided both squares are unoccupied (white dots in the diagram); or the pawn can capture an opponent's piece on a square diagonally in front of it on an adjacent file,
  by moving to that square (black "x"s). A pawn has two special moves: the en passant capture and promotion.</li>
    </ul></div>

  <h2>End of The Game</h2>
  
  <p>When a king is under immediate attack by one or two of the opponent's pieces, it is said to be in check. 
A move in response to a check is legal only if it results in a position where the king is no longer in check. 
This can involve capturing the checking piece; interposing a piece between the checking piece and the king (which is possible only if the attacking piece is a queen, rook, or bishop and there is a square between it and the king); or moving the king to a square where it is not under attack.
Castling is not a permissible response to a check. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent; this occurs when the opponent's king is in check, and there is no legal way to remove it from attack.
It is never legal for a player to make a move that puts or leaves the player's own king in check. In casual games, it is common to announce "check" when putting the opponent's king in check, but this is not required by the rules of chess and is not usually done in tournaments.
  
  <h2>Time Control</h2>
  
  <p>In competition, chess games are played with a time control. In competition, chess games are played with a time control.
 If a player's time runs out before the game is completed, the game is automatically lost (provided the opponent has enough pieces left to deliver checkmate).
 The duration of a game ranges from long (or "classical") games, which can take up to seven hours (even longer if adjournments are permitted), to bullet chess (under 3 minutes per player for the entire game).
 Intermediate between these are rapid chess games, lasting between 20 minutes and two hours per game, a popular time control in amateur weekend tournaments.
 Time is controlled using a chess clock that has two displays, one for each player's remaining time. Analog chess clocks have been largely replaced by digital clocks, which allow for time controls with increments.
 Time controls are also enforced in correspondence chess competition. A typical time control is 50 days for every 10 moves.</p>
